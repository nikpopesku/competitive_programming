# Week 1: Array/Permutation Construction

## Monday: Learning
- **Technique**: Array/Permutation Construction with Greedy Patterns
- **Tutorial/Link**: CF 1462C editorial, LeetCode 667 approach
- **Key Insight**: Working backwards from constraints, often involves adjacent operations or two-pointer strategies
- **Example**: Creating unique numbers from sum (CF 1462C), constructing arrays with specific differences (LeetCode 667)

## Wednesday: Practice
- **Problem 1**: [x] Solved - CF 1462C (Unique Number)
- **Problem 2**: [x] Solved - LeetCode 667 (Beautiful Array)
- **Problem 3**: [x] Solved - LeetCode 526 (Beautiful Arrangement)
- **Struggles**: Initially struggled with greedy approach in CF 1462C, had to think about working backwards from the sum

## Thursday: Optimization
- **Found Better Solution**: [x] Yes
- **What I Learned**: Two-pointer construction pattern (LeetCode 667), backtracking with pruning (LeetCode 526), greedy digit selection (CF 1462C)

## Friday: Competition
- **Contest**: Virtual participation
- **Used Today's Technique**: [x] Yes - permutation construction patterns
- **Performance**: Successfully applied constructive thinking to array problems

## Weekend: Free Choice
- **Solved**: CSES 1072 (Two Knights) - combinatorial construction
- **Most Interesting**: CSES 1072 - elegant formula for non-attacking positions

## Weekly Reflection
- **What became intuitive**: Working backwards from constraints, two-pointer construction approach
- **Still confused about**: More complex graph construction techniques
- **Fun level (1-10)**: 8
- **Next week focus**: String Construction (palindromes, lexicographical optimization)
