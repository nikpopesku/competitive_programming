#### **Wednesday: SOLVE**
- Complete at least 1 problem with the technique
- If stuck >2 hours, read editorial but implement yourself

#### **Thursday: OPTIMIZE**
- Review others' solutions for the same problems
- Try to improve your solution (time/memory/elegance)

#### **Friday: COMPETE**
- Join a live contest or do a virtual one
- Look for opportunities to use the week's technique

#### **Weekend: EXPLORE**
- Free choice! Solve anything interesting
- Or work on your visualization projects

### Weekly Checklist
```
Week ___: [Technique Name]
□ Learned theory (Monday)
□ Solved practice problems (Wednesday)
□ Reviewed optimizations (Thursday)
□ Applied in contest (Friday)
□ Weekly reflection: ___________________
```

### Monthly Review Questions
1. What construction patterns are becoming intuitive?
2. Which type of problems give me the most "aha!" moments?
3. What new techniques should I add to the queue?
4. Am I still having fun? (If no, adjust!)

## 🎮 ACCOUNTABILITY REMINDERS

### "How to Restart After a Break"
1. Open this file
2. Find current technique in queue
3. Pick the first "Go-To Problem" you haven't solved
4. Start there - no need to "catch up", just continue

### "When Feeling Unmotivated"
- Remember: Your interest = algorithm design + math insights + learning
- Pick a "beautiful" problem from the go-to list
- Focus on the insight, not just the solution

### "When Progress Feels Slow"
- Look back at your solved problems folder
- Each construction pattern learned is a permanent skill
- Even "failed attempts" build intuition
